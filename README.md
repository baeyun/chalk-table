# Chalk Table

`chalk-table` is a small terminal table tool that comes with chalk support out of the box.

It is a project I forked from [@deoxxa](http://github.com/deoxxa)'s cool `asciitable` package. I've added support for chalk and a few extra fixes. In case you're wondering, it can still render simple tables with headings and pretty hyphen/pipe character-based formatting.

There are a few differences from `asciitable`'s default settings. For starters, the `intersectionCharacter` option defaults to a `+` character. For more documentation or a _getting-started_ guide, head over to `asciitable`'s [repository](https://github.com/deoxxa/asciitable).

Happy hacking!
